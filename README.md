### Hi there, welcome to my Github!

I’m passionate about turning data into insights. Whether it’s analyzing trends, uncovering hidden patterns, or optimizing pipelines, I find creative ways to solve problems with my data skills and experiences! I’ve worked primarily with R but also a good amount of Python and bash. And I love to experiment with SQL in my personal projects too!

This Github is where I showcase my coding and data analysis skills. Feel free to explore my repos and check out my latest SQL project.

There're always new ideas and new projects brewing, so be sure to drop by again!
